Sentence Smash
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence 
and returns the sentence. 
You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, 
but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, 
there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example:
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

char *smash(const char **words, size_t count){
    int total_len = count - 1;
    for (int x = 0; x < count; ++x)
        total_len += strlen(words[x]);
    
    char *r = malloc(total_len + 1);
    if (!r) return 0;
  
    for (int x = 0, fwd = 0; x < count; ++x)
        fwd += sprintf(r + fwd, "%s ", words[x]);
    
    r[total_len] = 0;
    return r;
