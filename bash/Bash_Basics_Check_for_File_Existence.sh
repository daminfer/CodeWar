# Write a BASH script which checks for a given file. 
# If the file exists, print "Found *fileName*" to stdout, otherwise print "Can't find *fileName*."
# If no arguments are supplied, print "Nothing to find"

# Examples:

# file exists: 
# run_shell file1.txt --> "Found file1.txt"

# file doesn't exist:
# run_shell file1.txt --> "Can't find file1.txt"

# No arguments:
# run_shell --> "Nothing to find"
# Please note: the locate command is unavailable on Codewars.

# Test: If we have arguments
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Nothing to find"
fi
# Test: if file exist
if [ -e $1 ]
then
    echo "Found $1"
else
    echo "Can't find $1"
fi
