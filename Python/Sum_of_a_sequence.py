"""
Your task is to make function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.

The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step (inclusive).

If begin value is greater than the end, function should returns 0

Examples

2,2,2 --> 2
2,6,2 --> 12 (2 + 4 + 6)
1,5,1 --> 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)
1,5,3  --> 5 (1 + 4)
"""

def sequence_sum(begin_number, end_number, step):
    acc = 0
    if begin_number > end_number:
        return 0
    for i in range(begin_number,end_number+1,step):
        acc = acc + i
    return acc
